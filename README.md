🏍️ RiderMate — Personal Ride Safety + AI Riding Coach

RiderMate is a smart ride-tracking and safety application designed for two-wheeler riders in India. It helps riders stay safe, get real-time insights during their trip, and learn safer habits with the help of an AI Ride Coach powered by OpenAI.

RiderMate is built as a Flutter mobile + web app, with a custom Node.js backend for AI processing.
